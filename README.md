<h1 align="center">pere</h1>

## Description
Lists directories and files how I like.  Name short for перечислять or (perechislyat'); that is, to enumerate/list.

Disclaimer: this is an fairly simple script, which hardly compares to, for example, [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa).  This programme is still in early phases of development, since being ported from C.

## Quick Start
```bash
$ ./compile.sh
$ ./pere -h
```
